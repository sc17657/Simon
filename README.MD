Sue's Simomn Game

    Description
        This Program is a simple game of Simon, replicating the 80's electronic game.  It can be used for passing the time or relaxing after a hard days work.

    Brief Example
       The game flashes a series of light when the player clicks on the start button.  The user then repeats the sequence to win the round.  As the play wins the round the number of lights increase, making it more difficult.

    List of Features / User Stories
        Currently the program is at the MVP stage. The features include a short series of hard coded lights that the player can repeat and the will recieve a "You win" alert.

        In the future, the program will include a random array of light flashes that the computer chooses.  Once the player wins a round, the number of lights will increase, making the game increasingly more difficult.  

        The program will also track the number of winning rounds to be displayed in new block on the screen.
